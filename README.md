📦 Spoljarevic – Docker/Podman Compose Collection

A small set of ready‑to‑run Compose files that spin up useful services (MySQL, Semaphore UI, …) with Docker, Podman, or any OCI‑compatible runtime.
Everything is wired for local development and self‑hosted production while keeping secrets out of version control.
